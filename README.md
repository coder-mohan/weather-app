# Weather App
Welcome to the Weather App GitHub repository! This project is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather for their current location or search for the weather in another place. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and it relies on a weather API to fetch weather data.




## Demo

You can see a live demo of the Weather App here:

## Features

- Search Weather: Users can enter the name of a place in the search box to get the weather information for that location.
- Weather Data: The app fetches weather data from a third-party API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information.
- Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, including mobile devices and desktops.

## API Reference
The Weather App uses a third-party weather API to fetch weather data. You will need to sign up for an API key and replace the placeholder in the JavaScript code with your own API key. You can obtain an API key from Weather API Provider and insert it into the following code in js/weather.js:

```bash
  const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```
